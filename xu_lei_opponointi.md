## Xu Lei Phase 1 notes



> Does corporate social responsibility create value for acquiring firms shareholder?

* you are not very far yet
* How do you do regression more specifically?
    * we do not have blue state
    * what are acquirer/ deal-specific vars
* what papers are you referring to
* please define stuff..

* replicate on US with newer data and see if still exists
* how are you going to get the data???

* Why adjusted CSR and not announcement return
* From what paper are the appendices from?

* Focus on data and methodology
    *. unique, probably not done in nordics
    * 


## 2SLS\
> do ablation analysis (replace a few vars see what happens)

* data tough to get for nordics. Can you get all vars? 
* what nordic country?

* independent: adjusted CSR
    * feedback loop and endogenousness (thus 2SLS)
* dependent
    * religion rank (difficult for nordics)
    * hefindahl, how much competition
    * g index (?)
    * scaled wealth perf sensitivity
    * acq details
        * firm size
        * leverage
        * free CF

## What is an merger?

> A merger is the voluntary fusion of two companies on broadly equal terms into a new legal entity.

* A merger is an agreement that unites two existing companies into one new company. 
* There are several types of mergers and also several reasons why companies complete mergers. 
* Mergers (and acquisitions) are commonly done to expand a company’s reach, expand into new segments, or gain market share. All of these are done to increase shareholder value.

### What is Corporate social responsibility?

* Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a self-regulating business model that helps a company be socially accountable — to itself, its stakeholders, and the public.
* By practicing corporate social responsibility, also called corporate citizenship, companies can be conscious of the kind of impact they are having on all aspects of society including economic, social, and environmental. 
* To engage in CSR means that, in the normal course of business, a company is operating in ways that enhance society and the environment, instead of contributing negatively to them.



## What Are Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Criteria?

> Environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria are a set of standards for a company’s operations that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments. 

* Environmental criteria consider how a company performs as a steward of nature. 
* Social criteria examine how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates. 
* Governance deals with a company’s leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights.


##  What Is a Socially Responsible Investment?

> An investment that is considered socially responsible because of the nature of the business the company conducts. 

* Common themes for socially responsible investments include avoiding investment in companies that produce or sell addictive substances (like alcohol, gambling, and tobacco) and seeking out companies engaged in social justice, environmental sustainability and alternative energy/clean technology efforts. 

* Socially responsible investments can be made in individual companies or through a socially conscious mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF).


## What is two-stage least squares?



* Two-Stage least squares (2SLS) regression analysis is a statistical technique that is used in the analysis of structural equations.  
* This technique is the extension of the OLS method.  
* It is used when the dependent variable’s error terms are correlated with the independent variables. Additionally, it is useful when there are feedback loops in the model.  
* In structural equations modeling, we use the maximum likelihood method to estimate the path coefficient.  This technique is an alternative in SEM modeling to estimate the path coefficient.  This technique can also be applied in quasi-experimental studies.

## Blue state
* vote democrats

## What is the G-index?

* The g-index is an index for quantifying productivity in science, based on publication record (an author-level metric). It was suggested in 2006 by Leo Egghe.[1]

The index is calculated based on the distribution of citations received by a given researcher's publications, such that given a set of articles ranked in decreasing order of the number of citations that they received, the g-index is the unique largest number such that the top g articles received together at least g2 citations. 


## What Is the Fama and French Three Factor Model?

* The Fama and French Three-Factor Model (or the Fama French Model for short) is an asset pricing model developed in 1992 that expands on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) by adding size risk and value risk factors to the market risk factor in CAPM.

* This model considers the fact that value and small-cap stocks outperform markets on a regular basis. 
* By including these two additional factors, the model adjusts for this outperforming tendency, which is thought to make it a better tool for evaluating manager performance.


## What Is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)?

* The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is a common measure of market concentration and is used to determine market competitiveness, often pre- and post-M&A transactions.

The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is a commonly accepted measure of market concentration. It is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm competing in a market and then summing the resulting numbers. It can range from close to zero to 10,000. The U.S. Department of Justice uses the HHI for evaluating potential mergers issues.


## CSR has become an important part of firms' operation

## Why is CSR important
* more money 

## no of companies with csr

* 2017: 10400
* 2013: 8740 

* increased by 19% in 5 years
* do these companies release them annually?


## CSR in context of mergers
* Debate
    * Stakeholder maximization view: CSR creates value for investors who value responsible behavior 
    * Shareholder expense view: Managers that engage in social resp activities destroy shareholder's value and help other stakeholders

* Reverse causality
    * companies investment in CSR increases performance
    * well performing companies invest in CSR

* Acquisitions not studies since in this case the companies are so different in size and it is difficult to measure the CSR component (and less data)



## Previous research supports the stakeholder maximization view

* where are sources?
* what is religion rank? is it discrete
* no academic papers


###  1. High csr acquirers realize higher merger announcement returns
* A linear regression?
    * Independent: adjusted CSR/ Or return?
    * 7+ variables
    * What are acquirer/ deal specific variables?
    * elaborate on this one

### 2. higher announcement returns? what is value-weighted ptf?
* acquirer
* and the target
* but this was mergers

### 3. Larger increases post-merger op perf long term if  CSR (source?)

### 4. positive error in 3ff?

### 5. and 6. shorter mergers and less likely to fail




### Why 2SLS
It is used when the dependent variable’s error terms are correlated with the independent variables. Additionally, it is useful when there are feedback loops in the model.  


### Research plan

* Replicating previous results (authors?) in Nordics
* How do you get data

#### 1992 - 2007


* H1: High CSR acquirers realize higher merger announcement return
* adjusted CSR score

* what is the adjusted CSR score
    * we do not have blue states
    * what is the religion rank??
    * specific variables, define these
    * are you using 2SLS
* larger increases in post-merger LT perf


#### 2008 - 2013
* How would you combine company information from different databases?
    * Unique key and check that some values match
    * Your job to get the DBs (lol)
* How would you measure incentive system of a company?
    * what G-index
        * how good scientists (please define)
    * Herfindahl Index?
        * How does this relate to 
        * Market concentration


## App 2.
* small but stat signf returns after FF3F
