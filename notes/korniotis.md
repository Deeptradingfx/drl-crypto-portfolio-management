## Cryptocurrency fundamentals

* Bhambhwani et al. found evidence that two fundamentals influence cryptocurrencies: computing power (hash rate) and adoption levels
* Only mineable cryptos (not Ripple/ stellar/ bnb)
* Prominent not mineable
* significant long-run relationship 
* factor analysis: exposed to crypto risk factors (aggr computing power and adoption)
* even after accounting for returns of Bitcoin and momentum
* explain variation across a broad set of cryptos
* real fundamental is the viability of technology
* intristic value: computing power and adoption level
* there are alot of unobservable fundamentals 

## Computing power
* hash rate, or the power of the network donated by miners (as explained previously, solving crypto puzzles)
* While irresponsible usage of resources, this ensures that transactions flow securely and efficiently
* increases trust

## Network / adoptation
* practical usability
* measured by the unique number of active addresses that transact on the blockchain 
    * is this good? some cryptos require less addresses for securing. each tx, new address.
    * why not just no of tx.


## Fingdings:
* longterm these fundamentals predict
* sometimes prices deviate from fundamentals (temporary)
    * sentiment trading
* weekly data


## Methodology
* both non-stationary
* cannot use OLS because spurious (non causal increasement)
* conintegrated relationship between price and fundamentals
* Dynamic least squares to estimate cointegration relationship 
    * consistent estimates with  endogeous variables
    * some periods significant
    * others not
        * short term deviates from fundamentals


## Short term factors
> factor regressions

* price of bitcoin
    * most sentiment prone since moste well known
    * driving factor to other
* crypto momentum
    * sentiment trading inside the crypto
* statistically significant


## Long term
> Fundamentals

* hashrate
* adoption

## Criticism
* Other cryptos than mineable
* The hashrate is endogenous to price since the price gives larger blockrewards
