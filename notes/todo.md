weight chart: large dots instead of linechart 
    * gridlines to charts
    * x 's instead of dots (stars?)


## Progress
intro OK
Research Qs OK
Portfolio opt lit revise
ML lit OK
Dataset OK
Methodology OK (slight revise)
Results and findings Write after torstila
Discussion Write after torstila (can already write something)
Conclusion (write after torstila)

## onko mahollista oikeasti treidaa t채t채 strategiaa?
> important to Torstila

* takes tx costs into account
* just connect to poloniex api
* got poloniex data
* with small volumes, assumptions should hold
* maybe if I identify some market cond where profitable (trending perhaps? or going down?)

## Must do

* Rewrite lit review with how ML stuff should be done approach
    * genetic algos
    * korniotis
    * heaton
    * jiang
* Move Jiang stuff to methodology
* Write stuff about backtests
* Go through GD comments
* write discussion
    * model
        * did not really care about no of assets 
        * always learns that eq weighted good
        * 


* Discuss financial literature before ML literature. Describe old articles and korniotis. And then conclude that this study wanted to investigate a representation free approach, pure fina data

* Results: I should take an honest and convincing approach to my results and admit that the DL approach is not a viable trading strategy. I should clearly state that the results are unstable and provide reasoning on why this is the case.

* I should include a chapter on what type of machine learning models have previously been used in cryptocurrency price prediction. I should compare the deep learning approach to the previous attempts and justify why studying DL in price prediction is worthwhile investigating.
    * Phase 1 papers
    * Korniotis

* ML literature: Revise the whole literature review part to be aligned with the actual model I am using. I should justify its importance to my study by providing relevant examples instead of abstractions.



* Methodology 8 pg
    * on policy or off policy
    * deterministic or stochastic
        * Stochastic: next period's price tensor is unknown to the model and appears "random"
        * Deterministic: the choice of the next action (the weights) is calculated exactly
    * draw diagram of neural network
    * draw diagram of RL agent
    * make notes of selim amrouni ipynb
* Results and findings 25-40 pg
    * Charts
    * Tables

## Should have (2nd priority)
* Discussion 5-10 pg
* Conclusions 5-10 pg
    * Research summary
    * Practical implications
    * Limitations of the study
    * Suggestions for further research
* References: Citations to everywhere

## Could have (3rd priority)
* Bitcoin whitepaper to literature
* Momentum as a predictor?? or benchmark
    * ff5 momentum luottoluokitus
* Maybe RNN
* Maybe DDPG
* 3.3 Trustworthiness of the study
* taulukko t채rkeimmist채 olennaisista papereista


## Should't have (no priority)
* Markov decision processes and q learning
* No genetic algorithms


## Small doc changes
* Change policy gradient to deterministic
* add tx remainder mu image to jiang
* stability of learning

## Done
* Research questions
    * Research questions after intro?
