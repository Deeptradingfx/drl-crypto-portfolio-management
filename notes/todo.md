## onko mahollista oikeasti treidaa t채t채 strategiaa?
> important to Torstila

* takes tx costs into account
* just connect to poloniex api
* got poloniex data
* with small volumes, assumptions should hold
* maybe if I identify some market cond where profitable (trending perhaps? or going down?)

## Must do
* Dataset: 2 pg
    * Poloniex stuff
    * Train for longer periods
    * Test with Jiangs periods
    * Get newer data
* Methodology 8 pg
    * on policy or off policy
    * deterministic or stochastic
        * Stochastic: next period's price tensor is unknown to the model and appears "random"
        * Deterministic: the choice of the next action (the weights) is calculated exactly
    * draw diagram of neural network
    * draw diagram of RL agent
    * make notes of selim amrouni ipynb
* Results and findings 25-40 pg
    * Charts
    * Tables

## Should have (2nd priority)
* Discussion 5-10 pg
* Conclusions 5-10 pg
    * Research summary
    * Practical implications
    * Limitations of the study
    * Suggestions for further research
* References: Citations to everywhere

## Could have (3rd priority)
* Bitcoin whitepaper to literature
* Momentum as a predictor?? or benchmark
    * ff5 momentum luottoluokitus
* Maybe RNN
* Maybe DDPG
* 3.3 Trustworthiness of the study
* taulukko t채rkeimmist채 olennaisista papereista


## Should't have (no priority)
* Markov decision processes and q learning
* No genetic algorithms


## Small doc changes
* Change policy gradient to deterministic
* add tx remainder mu image to jiang
* stability of learning

## Done
* Research questions
    * Research questions after intro?
